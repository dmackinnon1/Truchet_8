# Truchet Book

This booklet shows all 256 4x4 Truchet patterns with rotational symmetry.

This is a LaTeX learning project that uses: 
- javascript to generate the patterns and the LaTeX code for each "tile family" page;
- the "Tufte book" class for formatting: https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/.

The latex file to be compiled is `book.tex`. The files main.tex and the .gtex ("generated tex") files are created by running `index.js`.

There are two GitHub actions that will generate the LaTeX files (`js build`) and compile them (`latex compile`). 

The latest version of the booklet generated via the GitHub action is saved in the repo.
